							The main room will be used as a working room apart from the opening and closing sessions and
							will thus act as a central point of information during that time. A new speaker will enter the
							stage every 15 min and present his/her prepared topic from the session proposal in a
							<strong>lightning-talk</strong> format. Much like in a barcamp we will then ask how many people
							in the main room would be interested in such a topic and assign the most fitting room to that
							group in order to dive into said topic. This room can then be used for a presentation, a
							discussion, to code or to build a new initiative, although that part <strong>should not exceed
							 90 minutes.</strong> Depending on the amount of proposals received in advance there will be
							room for spontaneous talks or topics that might emerge during the social interaction with other
							developers. We consider it important to keep room for these talks as well since they would
							need to be postponed until the next T3DD otherwise and weâ€™d lose the opportunity to react to
							demands from the community if all talks would have been planned out beforehand. This overall
							format allows to have up to 63 sessions with a maximum of 6 tracks in parallel and thus should
							offer more than enough space to cope with next-to-all topics that might come up.
