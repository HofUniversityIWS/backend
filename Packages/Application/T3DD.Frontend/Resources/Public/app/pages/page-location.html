							The Nuremberg castle is almost a thousand years old (it has been documented first in 1050)
							and offers the most modern youth hostel inside a castle. It has been modernized a couple of
							years ago and has had its grand re-opening in February 2013. The location is very centrally
							located, just above the historic city centre, with a magnificent view of the historic city centre.
							355 beds in high standard rooms with 2 to 6 beds each, all with en-suite shower and toilet,
							dining room, bistro, lounge, plenty seminar rooms, one great hall and state-of-the-art media
							equipment make this an unique experience.
